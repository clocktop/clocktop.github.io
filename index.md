## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profilepic.png">

I am a PhD student working in Dr. Matthew Johnston's Sensors and Integrated Microelectronics Labratory, [SIM Lab](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~johnstom/), at Oregon State University. 

## Research Interest

My research focuses on desinging novel sensing systems for various applications such as, low power sensing on the edge, stretchable electronics, and thermal airflow sensors. I like to take an inter-displinary approach to my research looking for innovations and improvements from the integraded circuits (IC) level with custom CMOS IC design, through the systems level designing custom hardware, and into the signal processing realm, designing custom algorithmns for signal detection.
